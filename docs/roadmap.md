Roadmap
=======

This is a roadmap of basic features that are needed to make AutoCog (and STA) usable.
It only considers a few weeks worth of work but I rarely have brain-cycles to work on this project.

Given that I am currently working alone on this project, I am not tracking work using issues and milestones.

In the roadmap below, each minor versions integrates the incremental progress of the previous ones.
Simply, all the `v0.4.X` are steps toward `v0.5`.
These bugfix level milestones are subject to reordering (change of priority) and shifting (introducing new milestone or actual bugfixes).
