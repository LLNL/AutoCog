Automaton & Cognition explores mechanisms to build automaton that control applications driven by auto-regressive language models.
To this end, we defined a programming model, Structured Thoughts, with a language that compiles to a set of automaton.

We broke down the documentation into a few files:
 - [setup](./docs/setup.md)
 - [usage](./docs/usage.md)
 - [language](./docs/language.md)
 - [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md)
 - [roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md)

The libraries have [their own documentation](./library/README.md).
