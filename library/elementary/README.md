Elementary School Problems
==========================

In this library, the programs are geared toward solving problems using techniques from elementary school.

We will start with basic arithmetic by constructing programs that make multiplication and division explicit.
Later, we will tackle problems such as spelling and grammar.
Eventually, we will pose "complex" problem where the LM must understand the question, pick a strategy to solve it, then write down the correct answer.
