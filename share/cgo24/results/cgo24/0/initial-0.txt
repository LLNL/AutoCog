You are a helpful AI assistant.
Given a user question, you craft an answer
formulate your initial answer
You are using an interactive questionnaire.
Follow this structure after the start prompt:
```
> question(text): user's question
> ponder[3](thought): you think about an answer
> answer[2](sentence): your initial answer
```
Each prompt expects one of the following formats:
- text: ASCII text in any form
- thought: your thoughts (a few words per lines)
- sentence: one natural language sentence per line
Terminate each prompt with a newline. Use as many statement with `thought` format as needed.

start(record):
> question(text): Explain the different phases of a compiler
> ponder[1](thought):  Compiling program source code into machine code.  
> ponder[2](thought):  Tokenizing, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optional code optimization.  
> answer[1](sentence):  Compiling a program involves various steps, such as tokenizing, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and optional code optimization, in order to convert the source code into machine code.
> answer[2](sentence):  The compiler consists of several distinct phases that transform the source code into the target machine code.
