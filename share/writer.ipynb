Beam search is a popular search algorithm that can be used to find the most likely sequence of symbols in a language defined by a finite automata. The algorithm works by expanding the search space by considering multiple paths at each step. This allows it to explore more of the search space without getting stuck in local optima. The complexity of the search process increases exponentially with the size of the search space,\n",
      "> story[2](paragraph):  so it is important to limit the search space as much as possible. One way to do this is to use a beam search limit, which limits the number of paths that can be explored at each step. This can help reduce the complexity of the search process, but it can also lead to suboptimal solutions. Another approach is to use a heuristic-based search algorithm, which uses heuristics to guide the search process and reduce the complexity.\n",
