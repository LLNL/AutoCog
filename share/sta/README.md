Structured Thought Automaton
============================

Working on language design:
 - [Frontend](frontend.ipynb): actual tests have been moved to [Unit-tests -- Frontend](../../tests/language/frontend.py)
 - [Backend](backend.ipynb): working on backend and Prompt Tree format (aka object or bytes-code style abstraction)
 - [Execute](execute.ipynb): working on the execution model
 - [Samples](samples.ipynb): design samples, semantically correct while not always making sense (using extra variables or missing annotations to test features)

## TODOs

 - Create a new set of MMLU programs for the library
